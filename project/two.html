                    <p>Abdus Salam was born in Jhang, a small town in what is now Pakistan, in 1926. His father was an official in the Department of Education in a poor farming district. His family has a long tradition of piety and learning.</p>

                <p>Abdus Salam was a very private individual, who kept his public and personal lives quite separate. He married twice; first time to a cousin, the second time as well in accordance with Islamic law. At his death, he was survived by three daughters and a son by his first wife, and a son and daughter by his second, Professor Dame Louise Johnson, formerly Professor of molecular biophysics at Oxford University. Two of his daughters are Anisa Bushra Salam Bajwa and Aziza Rahman</p>

In 1950 he received the Smith‚Äôs Prize from Cambridge University for the most outstanding pre-doctoral contribution to physics. He also obtained a PhD in theoretical physics at Cambridge; his thesis, published in 1951, contained fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics which had already gained him an international reputation.</span></p>

                    <h3 class="mb-5">Research</h3>
    <p>According to modern physics, four fundamental forces exist in nature. Electromagnetic interaction is one of these. The weak interaction‚Äîresponsible, for example, for the beta decay of nuclei‚Äîis another. Thanks to contributions made by Abdus Salam, Sheldon Glashow,and Steven Weinberg in 1968, these two interactions were unified to one single, called electroweak. The theory predicted, for example, that weak interaction manifests itself in ‚Äúneutral weak currents‚Äù when certain elementary particles interact. This was later confirmed.
        Salam's primary focus was research on the physics of elementary particles. His particular numerous groundbreaking contributions included:
        </p>
<ol>
    <li>two-component neutrino theory and the prediction of the inevitable parity violation in weak interaction;</li>
    <li>gauge unification of weak and electromagnetic interactions, the unified force is called the "Electroweak" force, a name given to it by Salam, and which forms the basis of the Standard Model in particle physics;</li>
    <li>predicted the existence of weak neutral currents, and W and Z bosons, before their experimental discovery</li>
    <li>symmetry properties of elementary particles; unitary symmetry</li>
    <li>‚Ä¢	renormalization of meson theories;</li>
    <li>‚Ä¢	gravity theory and its role in particle physics; two tensor theory of gravity and strong interaction physics;</li>
    <li>‚Ä¢	unification of electroweak with strong nuclear forces, grand unification theory;</li>
    <li>‚Ä¢	related prediction of proton-decay;</li>
    <li>‚Ä¢	Pati‚ÄìSalam model, a grand unification theory;</li>
    <li>‚Ä¢	Supersymmetry theory, in particular formulation of Superspace and formalism of superfields in 1974;</li>
