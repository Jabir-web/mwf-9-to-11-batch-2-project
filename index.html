In 1950 he received the Smith‚Äôs Prize from Cambridge University for the most outstanding pre-doctoral contribution to physics. He also obtained a PhD in theoretical physics at Cambridge; his thesis, published in 1951, contained fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics which had already gained him an international reputation.</span></p>

Those who knew him were well aware that he was magnanimous, arrived at decisions after discussing them, was decisive, quick and forceful. In addition, Salam instinctively helped people. He liked to help them in their careers and there are, no doubt, people all over the world who owe their careers in a greater or smaller measure to Salam.

    <p>According to modern physics, four fundamental forces exist in nature. Electromagnetic interaction is one of these. The weak interaction‚Äîresponsible, for example, for the beta decay of nuclei‚Äîis another. Thanks to contributions made by Abdus Salam, Sheldon Glashow,and Steven Weinberg in 1968, these two interactions were unified to one single, called electroweak. The theory predicted, for example, that weak interaction manifests itself in ‚Äúneutral weak currents‚Äù when certain elementary particles interact. This was later confirmed.
        Salam's primary focus was research on the physics of elementary particles. His particular numerous groundbreaking contributions included:

    <h3 class="mb-5 text-center">Awards</h3>
   
    <h4>Adams Prize (Cambridge University) (1958)</h4>

    <p>The Adams Prize is one of the University's oldest and most prestigious prizes. The Prize is named after the mathematician John Couch Adams and was endowed by members of St John's College. It commemorates Adams's role in the discovery of the planet Neptune, through calculation of the discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus. Previous prize-winners include James Clerk Maxwell, Dr Abdus Salam and Stephen Hawking.</p>

       <h4>Hughes Medal (Royal Society, London) (1964)</h4>    

       <p>The Hughes Medal is awarded by the Royal Society of London for original discoveries in electricity and magnetism or their applications. It was awarded to Abdus Salam for his distinguished contributions to quantum mechanics and the theory of fundamental particles </p>

       <h4>Guthrie Medal and Prize (1976)</h4>
       <p>The Guthrie Medal and Prize is a prize awarded annually by the Institute of Physics since 1914 in memory of Frederick Guthrie, founder of the Physical Society. {The Physical Society merged with the Institute of Physics in 1960}.

        Until 1966 it took the form of the Guthrie Lecture after when it was replaced by the Guthrie Medal and Prize.</p>
